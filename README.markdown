# Html class and ID extractor

Scan a directory for html files and extract all classes and IDs.
From this data static C# classes are generated that can be used with your code using the [SharpKit](http://sharpkit.net) C#->JavaScript generator.

This will help finding selectors while writing code and avoid mistyping.
